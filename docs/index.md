# Abstract

Provide a brief overview of the project objectives, approach, and results.

Traditional machine learning methodâ€™s for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is significantly impacted due to data missingness. Our goal through this project is to build robust models that not only impute the signals but also use these imputed signals for the task of activity recognition. Moreover, we will also investigate the types of missingness and their distribution, especially for Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have successfully worked with time-series data due to their ability to learn temporal features and dependencies. Our approach will be to perform a comparative study between some of the existing RNN-based SOTA models for the task of HAR classification on the UCI HAR dataset. We will be implementing a Bidirectional RNN based on the BRITS architecture (SOTA for HAR imputation) and comparing it against an attention-based RNN based on the SAITS architecture (SOTA for generalized time-series imputation). Moreover, we will evaluate these architectures over multiple thresholds of missingness and various types of missingness like Missingness at Random (MAR), Missingness Completely at Random (MCAR), and Missingness Not at Random (MNAR).
